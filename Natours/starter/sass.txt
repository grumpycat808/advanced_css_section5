SASS
* CSS preprocessor
* Partials and imports
* When using mixins the code can be written once and included everywhere
* When using extends, the selectors are copied 

Using NPM to compile SASS
* run <npm init>
* run <npm install node-sass>

* Set anchor elements to display:inline-block so that we can add margin and padding
