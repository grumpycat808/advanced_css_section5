Three pillars of Good HTML/CSS
* Responsive images
* Correct units
* Desktop first vs mobile first

Maintainable and Scalable Code
Web Performance
* Fewer images, compress images
* Fewer HTTP requests
* Compress Code
* CSS preprocessor
* 

Specificity
* Styles can come from the CSS author, browser default, user agent
* Importance > Specificity > Source Order
* Inline styles > ID > classes > elements
* (inline, id, classes/pseudo classes, elements/pseudo elements)
* Rely on specificity rather than Order
* Author stylesheet should come last after 3rd party stylesheets

CSS Architecture
* Component-driven design. Divide interfaces into modular building blocks 
* Re-usable across a project and possibly across many projects
* Components shouldn't depend on their parent elements

BEM Pattern
.block {} example: class="card"
.block__element {} example: class="card__button"
.block__element block__element--modifier {} example: class="card__button card_button--active"
